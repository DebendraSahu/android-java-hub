### Introduction to Java

Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is a general-purpose programming language intended to let application developers write once, run anywhere (WORA), meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need for recompilation.

#### Key Features of Java
1. **Simple**: Java's syntax is easy to learn and similar to C++.
2. **Object-Oriented**: Everything in Java is an object which models real-world objects.
3. **Portable**: Java code is platform-independent due to its bytecode.
4. **Secure**: Java has built-in security features.
5. **Robust**: Java has strong memory management and exception handling features.
6. **Multithreaded**: Java supports multithreaded programming which allows you to perform multiple tasks simultaneously.

#### Setting up the Development Environment
To start writing Java programs, you need to:
1. Install the Java Development Kit (JDK) from [Oracle's official website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html).
2. Choose an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, or NetBeans.

#### Writing and Running Your First Java Program

Let's create a simple Java program that prints "Hello, World!" to the console.

1. Open your favorite IDE or a text editor.
2. Create a new file named `HelloWorld.java`.
3. Write the following code:

```java
// HelloWorld.java
public class HelloWorld {
    // The main method is the entry point of any Java program
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // This line prints "Hello, World!" to the console
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}
```

#### Explanation of the Code

- **public class HelloWorld**: This declares a class named `HelloWorld`. In Java, every application must have at least one class definition that contains the main method.
  
- **public static void main(String[] args)**: This is the main method which is the entry point of any Java program. It is always written in this way:
  - `public`: Access modifier allowing the method to be called from outside the class.
  - `static`: Means that the method belongs to the class, not instances of it.
  - `void`: Indicates that the method does not return any value.
  - `main`: The name of the method that Java looks for when running the program.
  - `String[] args`: An array of `String` arguments passed to the main method.

- **System.out.println("Hello, World!");**: This line prints the string "Hello, World!" to the console. `System` is a class, `out` is a static member of the `System` class, and `println` is a method of the `PrintStream` class that prints the passed string to the console followed by a new line.

#### Compiling and Running the Program

1. Open the terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory where `HelloWorld.java` is saved.
3. Compile the program by typing:
   ```sh
   javac HelloWorld.java
   ```
   This command compiles the source file into bytecode, creating a `HelloWorld.class` file.
4. Run the compiled bytecode by typing:
   ```sh
   java HelloWorld
   ```
   You should see the output:
   ```sh
   Hello, World!
   ```
